### Private Horses

Sick of having your horse, donkey, or mule jacked? <br>
With this mod, you can relax â€” no one but you can ride or leash your animal now!

---

Also, I adapted the idea of transferring the animal from [Transferable Pets](https://modrinth.com/plugin/transferable-pets) mod. <br>
It works same way: leash your horse/donkey/mule, press shift and right-click on a player you want transfer to.

If you`re not using Polymer this config will be generated.
```yaml
# Message translations
message:
  # 'AnimalName' is owned by 'PlayerName'
  owned_by: '%s is owned by %s'
  
  # 'PlayerName' is new owner of 'AnimalName'
  new_owner: '%s is new owner of %s'
  
  # 'PlayerName' transferred 'AnimalName' to you
  transfer: '%s transferred %s to you'
```
